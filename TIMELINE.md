- ConceptExpress: Unsupervised Concept Extraction (UCE): We focus on the unsupervised problem of extracting multiple concepts from a single image. Given an image that contains multiple concepts, we aim to harness a frozen pretrained diffusion model to automatically learn the conceptual tokens. Using the learned conceptual tokens, we can regenerate the extracted concepts with high quality. · <https://haoosz.github.io/ConceptExpress/>
